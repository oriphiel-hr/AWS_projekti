# Current Database Migration Status

## Summary
Based on CloudWatch logs analysis, migrations are NOT being applied to the database.

## Evidence from CloudWatch Logs

### Latest Migration Task Output:
```
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "uslugar", schema "public" at "uslugar-db.cr80o0eeg3gy.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"
9 migrations found in prisma/migrations
No pending migrations to apply.
```

### Seed Task Output (fails):
```
PrismaClientKnownRequestError: 
Invalid `prisma.subscriptionPlan.upsert()` invocation:
The table `public.SubscriptionPlan` does not exist in the current database.
```

## Analysis

### What's Happening:
1. ✅ Migration file exists in `prisma/migrations/20250121_add_subscription_plan_and_anonymous_job_support/`
2. ✅ Prisma sees 9 migrations in total
3. ❌ Migration task says "No pending migrations to apply"
4. ❌ Seed fails because `SubscriptionPlan` table doesn't exist

### Possible Explanations:

#### Theory 1: Migration was already marked as applied (false positive)
- Migration might be in `_prisma_migrations` table
- But actual SQL wasn't executed
- Table wasn't created

#### Theory 2: Migration file exists but isn't being recognized
- Migration file is in folder
- But Prisma doesn't see it as pending
- Never gets executed

#### Theory 3: Migration SQL has errors (silent failure)
- Migration is "applied" in records
- But SQL execution failed silently
- No table created

## What Needs to be Verified:

### Run these queries in the database to confirm:

```sql
-- 1. Check if migration is recorded (even if it failed)
SELECT migration_name, applied_steps_count, started_at, finished_at, rolled_back_at
FROM _prisma_migrations 
WHERE migration_name LIKE '%20250121%' OR migration_name LIKE '%subscription%'
ORDER BY started_at DESC;

-- 2. Check ALL migrations to see count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM _prisma_migrations;

-- 3. Check if table actually exists
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'SubscriptionPlan';

-- 4. List all tables to verify
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected (if migrations worked):
- `_prisma_migrations` has 9+ records
- `SubscriptionPlan` table exists
- `Job` table has nullable `userId`
- `Job` table has `linkingToken` columns

### Actual (from logs):
- Unknown count of migrations in `_prisma_migrations`
- `SubscriptionPlan` table does NOT exist
- Seed fails when trying to use table

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Database Check**: Run the verification queries above in AWS RDS Query Editor
2. **Compare Results**: Check if migration is recorded vs. table existing
3. **Diagnose Root Cause**: Figure out why migration didn't create table
4. **Apply Fix**: Either re-run migration or manually create table

## Quick Verification Command

Use AWS CloudShell to quickly check:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD="Pastor123"
psql -h uslugar-db.cr80o0eeg3gy.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U uslugar_user -d uslugar -c "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'SubscriptionPlan') as has_table,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM _prisma_migrations WHERE migration_name LIKE '%20250121%') as has_migration;
"
```

Expected result if migration worked: `has_table=1, has_migration=1`  
Expected result if migration failed: `has_table=0, has_migration=0` (or `has_migration=1` if recorded but didn't execute)
