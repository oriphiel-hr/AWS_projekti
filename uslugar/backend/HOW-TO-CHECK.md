# How to Check Database Migration Status

## Current Situation

**I cannot directly connect to your database** because:
1. ❌ No direct `psql` access from my environment
2. ❌ RDS Data API is not enabled
3. ❌ RDS Query Editor requires IAM authentication

## What I Found from CloudWatch Logs

```
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "uslugar", schema "public" at "uslugar-db.cr80o0eeg3gy.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"
9 migrations found in prisma/migrations
No pending migrations to apply.
```

**But seed fails with:**
```
The table `public.SubscriptionPlan` does not exist in the current database.
```

## How YOU Can Check

### Option 1: AWS CloudShell (Easiest)

1. Open AWS CloudShell: https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Click CloudShell icon (top right)
3. Run these commands:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL client
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client

# Connect to database
export PGPASSWORD="Pastor123"
psql -h uslugar-db.cr80o0eeg3gy.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U uslugar_user -d uslugar

# Once connected, run these SQL queries:
```

```sql
-- Quick check - everything in one query
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'SubscriptionPlan') as has_subscription_plan,
  (SELECT is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Job' AND column_name = 'userId') as job_userid_nullable,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Job' AND column_name IN ('linkingToken', 'linkingTokenExpiresAt')) as has_linking_columns,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM _prisma_migrations WHERE migration_name LIKE '%20250121%') as has_migration;

-- Expected if migrations worked:
-- has_subscription_plan=1, job_userid_nullable=YES, has_linking_columns=2, has_migration=1

-- Expected if migrations failed:
-- has_subscription_plan=0, job_userid_nullable=NO, has_linking_columns=0, has_migration=0
```

### Option 2: DBeaver / pgAdmin / Any SQL Client

1. Install DBeaver (free): https://dbeaver.io/download/
2. Create new PostgreSQL connection:
   - Host: `uslugar-db.cr80o0eeg3gy.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Database: `uslugar`
   - Username: `uslugar_user`
   - Password: `Pastor123`
3. Run the SQL queries above

### Option 3: EC2 Instance with psql

If you have an EC2 instance in the same VPC, SSH to it and use `psql` from there.

## What to Look For

### ✅ Migration SUCCESSFUL if you see:
- `has_subscription_plan = 1` (table exists)
- `job_userid_nullable = YES` (userId is nullable)
- `has_linking_columns = 2` (both linkingToken columns exist)
- `has_migration = 1` (migration recorded)

### ❌ Migration FAILED if you see:
- `has_subscription_plan = 0` (table doesn't exist)
- `job_userid_nullable = NO` (userId is still required)
- `has_linking_columns = 0` (linkingToken columns don't exist)
- `has_migration = 0` (migration not recorded)

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Migration Failed:
1. The migration was never applied to the database
2. We need to either:
   - Manually trigger the migration again
   - Or manually create the tables using the SQL from the migration file

### If Migration Succeeded:
1. The migration was applied
2. But something else is wrong (maybe caching issue)
