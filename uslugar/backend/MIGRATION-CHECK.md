# Database Migration Verification

## Overview
This document verifies what database changes should have been applied by workflows #62, #63, and #64.

## Workflows Analyzed

### Workflow #62 (Commit df2b7d1)
**Title:** "Implement database-driven pricing: migrate from hardcoded plans to SubscriptionPlan model with admin CRUD"

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `SubscriptionPlan` model to schema.prisma
- ✅ Added seed data for SubscriptionPlan in seed.js
- ✅ Updated subscriptions.js to use database instead of hardcoded plans
- ✅ Added SubscriptionPlan to admin routes

**Expected Database Changes:**
- [ ] Create `SubscriptionPlan` table
- [ ] Insert subscription plan records (BASIC, PREMIUM, PRO)

### Workflow #63 (Commit 1a594d2)
**Title:** "Add anonymous job posting with email notification and job linking functionality"

**Changes:**
- ✅ Modified Job model in schema.prisma
- ✅ Made `Job.userId` nullable (for anonymous users)
- ✅ Added `linkingToken` and `linkingTokenExpiresAt` fields

**Expected Database Changes:**
- [ ] Alter `Job` table: make `userId` column nullable
- [ ] Add `linkingToken` column to `Job` table (TEXT, nullable)
- [ ] Add `linkingTokenExpiresAt` column to `Job` table (TIMESTAMP, nullable)

### Workflow #64 (Commit 424284c)
**Title:** "Trigger deployment workflows for anonymous job posting"

**Additional Changes (commit 996f143):**
- ✅ Added migration file: `20250121_add_subscription_plan_and_anonymous_job_support`
- ✅ Migration should apply all changes from #62 and #63

**Expected Database Changes:**
- [ ] Create `SubscriptionPlan` table (from #62)
- [ ] Alter `Job` table for anonymous users (from #63)
- [ ] Seed subscription plan data

## Database Verification Queries

### Check if SubscriptionPlan table exists:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'SubscriptionPlan';
```

### Check Job table structure:
```sql
-- Check if userId is nullable
SELECT column_name, is_nullable, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Job' AND column_name = 'userId';

-- Check for linkingToken column
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Job' AND column_name IN ('linkingToken', 'linkingTokenExpiresAt');
```

### Check migration history:
```sql
SELECT migration_name, applied_steps_count, started_at, finished_at 
FROM _prisma_migrations 
WHERE migration_name LIKE '%20250121%' OR migration_name LIKE '%subscription%' 
ORDER BY started_at DESC;
```

### Check SubscriptionPlan data:
```sql
SELECT name, displayName, price, credits, isPopular, displayOrder, isActive 
FROM "SubscriptionPlan" 
ORDER BY displayOrder;
```

## Expected Results

### If migrations were successful:
1. ✅ `SubscriptionPlan` table exists
2. ✅ `Job.userId` column is nullable
3. ✅ `Job.linkingToken` column exists
4. ✅ `Job.linkingTokenExpiresAt` column exists
5. ✅ Migration `20250121_add_subscription_plan_and_anonymous_job_support` appears in `_prisma_migrations`
6. ✅ SubscriptionPlan table contains 3 records (BASIC, PREMIUM, PRO)

### If migrations failed:
1. ❌ `SubscriptionPlan` table doesn't exist
2. ❌ `Job.userId` is still NOT NULL
3. ❌ `Job.linkingToken` columns don't exist
4. ❌ Migration doesn't appear in `_prisma_migrations`
5. ❌ No subscription plan data seeded

## Next Steps

### If migrations failed:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for the "prisma" job in each workflow
2. Look for CloudWatch logs from the migration task
3. Verify that the migration file was included in the Docker image
4. Check for SQL syntax errors in the migration file
5. Manually apply the migration if needed

### To manually verify current state:
Run the queries above against the production database to determine what changes were actually applied.

## Notes
- All three workflows failed at the "seed" job
- The common error was: `Table 'public.SubscriptionPlan' does not exist`
- This suggests the migration from workflow #62/#64 was never applied
- The anonymous job posting changes from workflow #63 also require the migration from #64
